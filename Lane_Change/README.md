This project is about a lane change maneuver for the autonomous vehicles using Deep Reinforcement learning. The project is made in the Open AI gym environment with 
custom made environment. The ego-car obsevres an obstacle in front of it and is required to do a lane change. For constructing model, I used Deep Double Q learning is used.
